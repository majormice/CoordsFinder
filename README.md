# CoordsFinder

CoordsFinder is the fastest Minecraft texture rotation cracker for cracking coordinates from a screenshot!

CoordsFinder is written in Rust and includes a portable multithreaded CPU backend and a [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs/) compute backend, so one build works across CPU-only systems, Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal.

## Usage

### Google Colab

You can run CoordsFinder directly on Google Colab with [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17qih1n6VpQx_77C2spIF-JOJp17y9Jt6?usp=sharing), without needing to install anything! An NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU is available for free.

### Pre-built binaries

Pre-built binaries are available for Windows, Linux, and Apple-silicon Macs. Each binary includes both the CPU and GPU backends. Download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/ALaggyDev/CoordsFinder/releases/latest).

The CPU backend has no additional runtime requirements. The optional GPU backend needs a driver with wgpu's `SHADER_INT64` feature. This is available through Vulkan, DirectX 12 with DXC, and Metal 2.3+ on supported hardware. In the default `auto` mode, CoordsFinder uses a compatible GPU when available and otherwise falls back to CPU.

### Build with Cargo

Requirements:

- Rust 1.87 or newer
- A supported GPU and driver if you want to use the optional GPU backend

Build and test:

```sh
cargo build --release
cargo test
```

The executable is `target/release/coordsfinder` (`coordsfinder.exe` on Windows).

## Run

To run CoordsFinder, provide a search config file as the first argument:

```sh
coordsfinder ./example.conf
```

CLI options:

```text
-b, --backend <auto|cpu|gpu>  Select the execution backend (default: auto)
-t, --threads <N>             Set the CPU worker count
-e, --validate                Validate and summarize without scanning
-o, --output <FILE>           Also append matches to FILE
-h, --help                    Show all options
-v, --version                 Show the version
```

For example, to select the CPU backend explicitly and use eight worker threads:

```sh
coordsfinder --backend cpu --threads 8 ./example.conf
```

Only matches are written to standard output. Device information, progress, and completion status are written to standard error, so match output can be redirected safely. Use `--output matches.txt` to also save matches to a file; without it, the program warns that matches are only on standard output. Press Ctrl+C to stop; CPU workers poll between X/Z columns and the GPU backend stops after its active tile.

## Search config

An example search config is included in [`example.conf`](./example.conf). It is a simple INI-like file with the following sections:

```ini
# Comments start with a hash. (#)

algorithm = Vanilla-3             # Vanilla-1, Vanilla-2, Vanilla-3, Sodium-1, Sodium-2
scanOrder = spiral                # linear, spiral, reverse-spiral
directions = [0]                  # 0, 90, 180, 270

xRange = (-5000, 5000)
yRange = (-60, 0)
zRange = (-5000, 5000)

errorTolerance = 0                # Maximum number of block errors accepted

cpuTileSize = (1024, 1024)
gpuTileSize = (8192, 8192)
verbose = false

[filter]
# x y z | variant [side|netherrack-<face>]
-6 0 0 | 3
-5 0 0 | 3
-6 0 -1 | 0 side
-5 0 -1 | 1 side
0 1 0 | 2 netherrack-up
0 1 0 | 0 netherrack-north
```

More examples can be found in the [`examples`](./examples) folder.

### Algorithm

Select the texture algorithm in the config. If unsure, use `Vanilla-3` as a safe default.

| Minecraft version | Algorithm   |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| <= 1.12.2         | `Vanilla-1` |
| 1.13-1.21.1       | `Vanilla-2` |
| 1.21.2+           | `Vanilla-3` |

| Sodium version | Minecraft version | Algorithm                     |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1.0-4.1        | 1.16-1.18.2       | `Sodium-1`                    |
| 4.2-4.8        | 1.19-1.19.3       | `Sodium-2`                    |
| 4.9+           | 1.19.3+           | Use the matching Vanilla mode |

### Scan order

Scan order determines the order in which tiles are scanned.

- `linear` starts from the minimum X/Z corner and moves to the maximum X/Z corner.
- `spiral` begins at the center and scans in a clockwise spiral pattern.
- `reverse-spiral` scans the same spiral path in reverse, from the outside inward.

### Directions

`directions` are **very important** if the cardinal direction of the screenshot is unknown. They tell CoordsFinder whether it should rotate the filter offsets and variants.

```ini
directions = [0, 90, 180, 270]
```

For example, if `directions = [0, 180]`, CoordsFinder scans the filter as-is and also scans it rotated 180 degrees horizontally. Four-state top-face samples are rotated with the direction; two-state `side` samples are not.

If the screenshot direction is unknown, it is recommended to use `directions = [0, 90, 180, 270]` or `directions = [0, 180]`.

NOTE: The `directions` are applied differently depending on top/bottom, side or netherrrack faces. Normal users should not need to worry about this.

### Scan ranges

The scan ranges define the candidate coordinate area. Range ends are exclusive.

### Error tolerance

Error tolerance dictates the maximum number of non-matching block errors allowed per candidate. Multiple face filters at the same offset are combined and count as one block error.

Note that error tolerance **severely impacts** performance. It is not recommended to use an error tolerance above 3.

### Tile sizes & verbosity (advanced)

The default tile sizes and verbosity are reasonable and typically do not need to be changed.

```ini
cpuTileSize = (1024, 1024)
gpuTileSize = (8192, 8192)
verbose = false
```

The selected backend uses its matching tile size, which determines the X/Z area scanned per work item. The legacy `cudaTileSize` name is accepted as an alias for `gpuTileSize`, so existing configs continue to work. Verbose mode prints progress for every work item.

### Filters

Filter rows use one of these forms:

```text
x y z | variant
x y z | variant side
x y z | variant netherrack-<face>
```

The first three numbers are the relative block coordinates to an origin. The fourth number is the visible texture rotation.

Depending on the type of block faces, additional keywords need to be used:
- For ordinary rotated blocks (e.g., grass block, dirt, stone, etc.), no additional keywords are needed.
- For side faces on mirrored blocks (e.g., stone, deepslate), the `side` keyword are used to indicate that the filter is a side face.
- For netherrack, the `netherrack-<face>` keyword is used to indicate the direction of the face. The `<face>` can be one of `up`, `down`, `north`, `south`, `east`, or `west`.

Multiple filters on the same block offset are merged into one block constraint to improve performance.

## FAQs

### Which blocks have texture rotations?

Here's a list of blocks that have "texture rotations", as of Minecraft 1.21.11. Note that I may have missed some blocks, and not all of them have been tested.

- Grass block
- Rooted Dirt
- Dirt
- Dirt path
- Stone & Infested stone, with side face variants
- Deepslate & Infested deepslate, with side face variants
- Bedrock, with side face variants
- Sculk, with side face variants
- Podzol
- Mycelium
- Sand
- Red sand
- All 16 colors of concrete powder
- Lily pad
- Sea pickle?
- Turtle egg?
- Netherrack

Flower random offsets are not part of the texture rotation algorithm (block variant model) but are instead hard-coded into the game. I will be looking into it in the future.

### How does texture rotation cracking even work?

I will spare my words here and instead link to these amazing resources that explain the concept in detail:

- [Texture Rotation Reverser Java](https://github.com/19MisterX98/TextureRotations) by 19MisterX98
- [Texture Exploit Guide](https://gitea.com/ChromeCrusher/Texploit-Guide) by ChromeCrusher

### What is the difference between WebCoordsFinder and CoordsFinder?

WebCoordsFinder is a web-based app. It allows users to upload a screenshot, draw the grid, mark the texture rotations, and either perform the scan on the app or download a config file to use in CoordsFinder. It is a convenient way to generate a config file without having to painstakingly mark and write it by hand.

CoordsFinder is a command-line tool that performs the actual brute-force search. It supports multithreaded CPU scanning and GPU acceleration through wgpu, and is much faster than the built-in WebCoordsFinder scanner on supported hardware.

In short: Start with WebCoordsFinder, and either use the built-in scanner or use CoordsFinder.

### I don't have a compatible GPU but I want to scan faster! What should I do?

Use the free [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17qih1n6VpQx_77C2spIF-JOJp17y9Jt6?usp=sharing)!

### Why did Windows say that the display driver stopped responding, or why did wgpu panic in `Buffer::map_async`?

Windows can reset the graphics driver when one GPU work item runs for too long; this is called Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR). After a reset, wgpu may instead panic with a validation error in `Buffer::map_async`, such as `Buffer with '' label is invalid`. This is a symptom of the GPU timeout. Reduce `gpuTileSize`, especially when using a nonzero `errorTolerance`, so each work item finishes sooner. If the scan is stable and work items finish quickly, increase `gpuTileSize` to reduce per-tile overhead.

### How is CoordsFinder so fast?

It is fast because:

- It is written in Rust, which is a compiled language with predictable performance.
- It uses multithreading on the CPU and compute shaders on the GPU to massively parallelize the search.
- The search implementations avoid unnecessary work in their inner loops and share precomputed scan data across candidates.

Optimization improvements and suggestions are very much appreciated!

### Why is texture rotation cracking relatively unknown to the Minecraft community?

Honestly I have no idea. Texture rotation cracking is certainly not a new concept, and there's a lot of information about it online (the earliest reference I can find was from 2019 by [hacker mann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6__hO4cc1pA)!). However, most of the information just didn't reach the general Minecraft community somehow. Instead, bedrock cracking and "cloud cracking" have taken the spotlight instead of texture rotation cracking, which is a shame.

Now, WebCoordsFinder basically perfected texture rotation cracking and made it accessible to everyone. I hope that this project will help spread awareness of texture rotation cracking and its immense power!
